# About
Hi! Name's Ricky- I'm an 19-year-old student from Spain; eager to learn and improve in the world of IT!

I'd call myself a very imaginative person with a constant urge to create and design- I'm a self-taught digital artist; I've worked in character design pieces, interesting and persuasive presentations, lovely business cards, thoughtful logos, and more!

With my extensive time spent around english-speaking communities, I've developed an effortless fluency in the language.

I'm focused on improving my soft skills, and being a great communicator!

I have completed a Vocational Education and Training course in IT Systems & Networking with an average score of 9.3/10- I'm currently thriving in a Vocational course in web development!


#🖥️ Proficient in Java, HTML/CSS/JS, PL/SQL
